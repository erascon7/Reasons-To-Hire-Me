## Reasons to hire me - #1: I take initiative

Before I go into the details I was recently inspired by Felipe Vogel’s article on his job search journey.

He gave a few pieces of advice on how to navigate these uncertain times in the job market that I think are beneficial for any individual who's been on a quest looking for their next dream role, including me. 

So I've decided to take the initiative here to be more active on LinkedIn, to post consistently, and to showcase my competencies. 

I believe by taking initiative, you go down a path of change. And in any company, in any workplace, there's always going to be change. The amount of change varies it can be little that it does nothing to affect you. Perhaps it could even be so significant it changes your Product Roadmap or even Sprint Backlog. So one must always take the initiative to be agile and adaptable to the changes that will surround the company and your position.

We can look back and prefer things the old way (even if they are legitimate reasons) or we keep moving forward to a successful Product Launch.

## Reasons to hire me - #2: Strategic Discovery

User discovery and customer research tends to be pretty biased. 

As PdMs we tend go to users and ask them questions regarding a specific problem that we’re trying to validate. We have a list questions that we ask knowing full well they’re going to reinforce what you think is wrong with the product. 

Personally, I have been a victim of that type of product thinking and that's the wrong approach. 

When approaching users, whether if you’re interviewing them live or sending a survey. You should send them a stack of problems that your users have been facing. Then you ask them to rank those problems on top of each other. 

For example, if you sent over 10 problems, ask them which problem should be #1 (highest priority issue) and which problem should be #10 (least priority issue). Whichever problem is number one, congratulations, you have now discovered your problem/idea to validate. 

Shreyas Doshi was the originator of this framework and I can honestly say once I adopted this into Product Discovery over the last couple of years it became a huge game changer.

Reasons to hire me - #3: Product Roadmapping

Product roadmapping is essential to understand what product/features will be worked on and when they will be released. Three different audiences can benefit from product roadmapping.  

1. The product/devs/design teams are an obvious one. Depending on the maturity level of your organization, there will usually be more than one product team. A roadmap for different product teams can clarify and allow visibility of what the different teams are working on and when the planned launches are determined to be, preventing conflicting dates. 

2. The entire company. I find that making the product roadmap visible to all employees boosts morale. What attracts employees to companies is believing in the mission. Sometimes employees especially on the IC side tend to get too caught up in the details that they forget the big picture. Allowing them to see the big picture reminds them of what they’re working towards. 

3. The shareholders, investors, and board of directors. This group tends to think about the future of the company, with good reason, more than any other audience type. They only need to see a high level to know in what direction the business and product are heading towards. From something as simple as quarterly milestones to even a five-year plan.

Honestly - there are plenty of groups that can benefit from product roadmaps but that’s a piece that could be a whole article. Roadmunk has a great series of chapters diving into those groups/details.
